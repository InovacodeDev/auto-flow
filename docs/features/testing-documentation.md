# Testing & Documentation Implementation

## Overview

Comprehensive testing framework and documentation for the AutoFlow Brazilian PME automation platform, ensuring production readiness with quality assurance for all integrations.

## Core Functionality

Complete test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end testing scenarios for all major platform components including IA system, WhatsApp Business API, PIX payments, CRM integrations, and ERP integrations.

## Technical Implementation

### Testing Framework Architecture

- **Unit Tests**: Jest-based test suites for individual services and components
- **Integration Tests**: API route testing and service interaction validation
- **End-to-End Tests**: Complete workflow testing across all integrations
- **Mock Services**: Comprehensive mocking for external API dependencies

### Test Coverage Areas

#### 1. ERP Integration Testing (`erp.test.ts`)

- Customer management with Brazilian document validation (CPF/CNPJ)
- Invoice generation with tax calculations
- Bank reconciliation for PIX payments
- Webhook processing for real-time updates
- Multi-platform support (Omie, ContaAzul, Bling)
- Error handling and network resilience

#### 2. Unified Integrations Testing (`unified-integrations.test.ts`)

- Integration registration and management
- Health monitoring across all platforms
- Operation recording and statistics
- Data synchronization between systems
- Configuration management
- Performance tracking and alerting

#### 3. API Routes Testing (`api-routes.test.ts`)

- Authentication and authorization flows
- ERP API endpoints validation
- Unified integrations dashboard APIs
- Error handling and CORS configuration
- Rate limiting and security middleware
- Request/response schema validation

#### 4. End-to-End Flow Testing (`e2e-flows.test.ts`)

- Complete sales flow: WhatsApp → CRM → ERP → PIX
- Payment confirmation and completion workflows
- Automated lead nurturing across platforms
- Data synchronization between all systems
- Error recovery and partial failure handling
- Performance and concurrent operation testing

### Key Testing Features
